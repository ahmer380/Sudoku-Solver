# Sudoku Solver: Archived from September 2022

## Retrospective review notes taken from [my personal website](https://ahmeralam.co.uk/) (2024)
*Enter your sudoku board, click the 'submit' button, and Voila! This Python project is a simple yet effective Sudoku Solver that utilises a backtracking algorithm in order to solve any solvable sudoku board efficiently. The solver was implemented using the Pygame module, providing a visually appealing and interactive interface for users to input their sudoku puzzles. The solver then processes the input and displays the solution on the screen, allowing users to easily verify the correctness of the solution.*
